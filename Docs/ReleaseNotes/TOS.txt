This is an EXPERIMENTAL PROOF-OF-CONCEPT UNTESTED offline MOULa
client with a built-in local server. This client doesn't connect to any
online server and the built-in server is not accessible over the network.

This is NOT a playable single-player version of MOULa!

Nothing has been adjusted for single-player gameplay. Various things
aren't configured properly, so parts of the game are inaccessible or
unplayable. The "server" part is incomplete and unstable, so the game
may randomly hang, exit with a "net" error, or crash outright. Progress is
saved automatically on your local disk, but the save data may get
corrupted randomly.

In short: don't use this if you want to play the game for real. Otherwise,
have fun poking around!
